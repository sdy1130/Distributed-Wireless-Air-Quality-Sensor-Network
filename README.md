Distributed Wireless Air Quality Sensor Network developed during my Research Internship at Technion, Israel Institute of Technology (May 2017 – August 2017).

- Developed a distributed system to measure an individual’s exposure to air pollution.
- Built a Raspberry Pi-based hardware programmed in Python, which is capable of detecting nearby Wi-Fi enabled devices by utilizing Wireshark, and analyzing the collected air quality data.
- Designed a database schema and utilized MySQL to manage the collected air quality data.
